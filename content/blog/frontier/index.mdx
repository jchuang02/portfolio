## The Design Process

From the start, our professor wanted our class to act as a design studio, and for
us to pursue design projects that we were interested in working on. The success of
our projects were dependent on the usability and user experience of our final designs.
We ideated as a class and then voted on the best ideas that we would want to design
for, forming small teams in the process.

Our team decided that we wanted to design a platform that would facilitate aspiring
designers/developers/project managers to advance their skills and careers by giving
them projects to work on directly on the platform. Once they complete a project,
they can display their work directly on the platform. The project specifications
themselves are created in collaboration with companies looking to hire. This model
would allow for aspiring job candidates to showcase their skills and capabilities
whilst allowing companies to handpick the type of skills they want to see in a potential candidate.

Our idea gained traction with our professor and our peers, but we needed to gain a
better understanding of what our user flow and potential users would look like. We
created customer journey maps and storyboards to showcase our understanding of how
our product would function to our professor and peers.

We then created user personas to further showcase our potential users and what they would look like.
We wanted to get an understanding of the specific pain points our users are facing to establish an
idea of how our platform would be addressing these difficulties.

Then to further confirm our audience definition, we created and distributed a customer
survey and performed user interviews. We asked them questions concerning their struggles
showcasing their skills and abilities to potential employers, what kind of work
they were willing to do to showcase these skills, and other concerns they had in
regards to the job hunting process.

We also drew up some low fidelity mock ups of our platform to do some user testing
with some potential users to see how our user flow would perform in action.

  </div>
</div>

After some refinements based on stakeholder feedback, we began working on a higher fidelity version of our wireframes for user testing, and eventually ended up with the final prototype that you can find here.

This prototype is meant to walk the users through the entire core product experience, from the discovery of the platform for the user to finally submitting a project.

We sent this prototype alongside specific instructions for testers to usertesting.com, a platform that gives users access to a large pool of testing candidates to test out prototypes and products with.

We scoped down our pool of users to our target audience of young professionals looking
 to or have only recently started their careers, asked these 10 individuals to go
 through our prototype, and finally give a score out of 10 for 2 particular metrics:

1. Likeliness to Use
2. Likeliness to Recommend

Our results were excellent with an 8.4 for likeliness to use and an 8.6 for likeliness to recommend

Other positive user feedback included:

- Aesthetically pleasing design
- Quick and easy understanding of the product from the landing page alone
- Overall intrigued and excited about the product idea

Here's a sneak peak of our final designs. For a more thorough experience, please check out our prototype [here](https://projects.invisionapp.com/share/4TBW3F5RK#/screens).
